# Practice
Make sure once you have the project in your system and editor to download TestNG library from your marketplace
Import all necessary annotations that come with the testng library e.g.(@Test, @BeforeTest)
Import all java packages (most of the objects used come from java packages. If you have any question about which imports to select feel free to ask)
